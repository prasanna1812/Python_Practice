1. Given a number n, find the product of all factors of n.
	Input : 20
	Output : 1*2*4*5*10 = 400


2. Integers X and K are given. The task is to find largest K-digit number divisible by X.
    (Hint - Use max function)
	Input : X = 83, K = 5
	Output : 99932 is the largest 5 digit number that is divisible by 83.


3. Integers X and K are given. The task is to find smallest K-digit number divisible by X.
   (Hint - Use min function)
	Input : X = 83, K = 5
	Output : 10043 is the smallest 5 digit number that is divisible by 83.


4. Given a string of lowercase characters from ‘a’ – ‘z’.
   We need to write a program to print the characters of this string in sorted order.
	Input : 'python'
	output: 'hnopty'

5. Given an list with N elements, task is to find the count of factors of a number X
   which is product of all list elements.
	Input : 3 5 7
	Output : 8
	3 * 5 * 7 = 105, the factors of 105 are 1,
	3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105 whose count is 8


6. Given a list, find the difference between highest occurrence and least occurrence of any number in a list
	Examples:
	Input : [7, 8, 4, 2, 4, 4, 1, 1, 7, 7, 2, 5]
	Lowest occurring element (5) occurs once.
	Highest occurring element (7) occurs 3 times
	In case of tie take lower number

7. We are given a 2D list of order N X M and a column number K ( 1<=K<=m).
   Our task is to sort the 2D list according to values in the Column K.
    Examples:
	Input : If our 2D list is given as (Order 4X4) 
		39 27 11 42 
		10 93 91 90 
		54 78 56 89 
		24 64 20 65
	Sorting it by values in column 3 
	Output :    
		39 27 11 42 
		24 64 20 65 
		54 78 56 89 
		10 93 91 90

8. Print the following pattern (for length n)
	1
	2 2
	3 3 3
	4 4 4 4
	5 5 5 5 5


9.	Write a function to check if the input number is prime or not

10. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3).
	If the given string is already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead.
	If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged
